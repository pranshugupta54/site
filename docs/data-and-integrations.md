# Data & integrations

## Content source
**All editable content is in `src/lib/site.ts`** (`SITE` const): name, role, location, email, `dob`, socials, `experience` (dated), `projects`, `competitive` (programming), `education`, `lead`/`bio`. The `lead` uses `{word}` to mark which word gets the animated highlight.

## Live data — "live or hidden, never fake"
- `src/lib/github.ts` (server-only): `getGithub()` → heatmap levels, total contributions, **followers**, streak (GraphQL); `getRepoStars(repo)` → live stars. **A `User-Agent` header is required** or GitHub returns 403.
- Widgets **return `null` (hide) on any failure / missing key** — no fake fallbacks. Digitomize stars render floored as `★ 600+`.
- Page revalidates hourly: `export const revalidate = 3600` in `app/page.tsx`.
- WakaTime was removed (user stopped using it). Spotify was never built. Don't re-add either without asking.

## Token safety (important)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a Vercel **server** env var — **no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix**, so it never reaches the client bundle.
- `src/lib/github.ts` must be imported **only by server components** (currently `github-panel.tsx`, `sections.tsx`). Never import it from a `"use client"` file, or the token could be bundled to the browser.

## Misc
- Favicon = `/me.jpeg` (his photo) via `metadata.icons` in `layout.tsx`.
